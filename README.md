# BubbleGame
The Bubble Game is a fun and engaging web-based game where players aim to click on bubbles that display a specific number to earn points within a 60-second countdown. It features a minimalist design with vibrant colors and straightforward gameplay mechanics.

Features:
Timer and Score Tracking: The game begins with a countdown timer set to 60 seconds. Players score points by clicking on bubbles that display a randomly generated target number, shown in the "Hit" box. Each successful click increases the score by 10 points.

Dynamic Bubble Generation: Bubbles are dynamically generated using JavaScript upon game initialization and after each successful click. This keeps the game challenging and unpredictable as new bubbles with different numbers appear.

Game Over and Restart: When the timer runs out, a "Game Over" message is displayed with the final score. Players can click "Play Again" to restart the game, resetting the score and timer for a new round of gameplay.

HTML: Provides the structure and layout of the game interface.

CSS: Styles the elements to enhance visual appeal and usability.

JavaScript: Implements game logic, including timer functionality, score tracking, bubble generation, and event handling for user interactions.
